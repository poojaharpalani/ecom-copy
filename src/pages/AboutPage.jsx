            If Grainne Morton was to have a spirit animal, no doubt it would be
            the magpie. Instinctively and obsessively drawn to collecting and
            hoarding anything miniature or precious that catches her eye, many
            things you or I would overlook, Grainne has amassed an incredible
            collection of objects – all destined to find their place among the
            tales she weaves within her jewelled compositions.

            Born and raised in Northern Ireland, by creative and antique-loving
            parents, Grainne was immersed in and surrounded by the traditional
            Crafts, Folklore, Music and Fairy Tales of the country. Perhaps it’s
            this beginning to her story that has now imbued her work with its
            somewhat contradictory nature? All at once vintage and contemporary,
            precious and non-precious, spontaneous and ordered, junk and
            treasure… this could well be a description of Grainne’s motherland
            itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her individuality, and the expression of that – primarily through
            clothes, style and the considered presentation of [her]self – is
            engrained in each piece of jewellery she makes. Each piece,
            carefully choreographed, the arranging and re-arranging of little
            objects, and precious things, moved and re-placed until they
            establish a relationship to each other. And tell a story to the
            viewer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving to Edinburgh, Scotland, in the late eighties to study at
            Edinburgh College of Art was the jump-off point for Grainne to
            become an avid collector of antiques and ephemera. When her parents
            visited her in Edinburgh, they would go on antique-buying trips for
            their shop at home in Northern Ireland, and Grainne would tag along.
            Her collections became her inspiration, and her inspiration became
            her work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grainne’s work has been exhibited internationally and, in 2007, she
            was shortlisted for the Jerwood Applied Arts Prize.
