            Grainne Morton is a small business working with around ten talented
            and highly valued individuals. Our core creative and business
            activity takes place in our studio in Grainne's garden in Edinburgh.
          </p>
          <p className="font-helvetica w-full md:max-w-xl mx-auto text-[#34474A]">
            Grainne's garden is a tiny but very special place. Plants and
            flowers are plentiful, encouraging local wildlife to thrive. Our
            studio is small and low impact with three of the team working there
            daily.

          <p className="font-helvetica w-full md:max-w-xl mx-auto text-[#34474A]">
            Our ethos has always been that handmade is quality made, and that
            there is beauty in breathing new life into antique and natural
            objects through our jewellery.
          </p>
          <p className="font-helvetica w-full md:max-w-xl mx-auto text-[#34474A]">
            At Edinburgh College of Art in the 90s, Grainne stood out for her
            use of vintage buttons, stamps and ephemera in her pieces. Over the
            years Grainne's collections of antique and natural objects has grown
            to meet the increasing love for her pieces. Today, many of the
            pieces we use in our production come from disused stocks of, for
            example, vintage rhinestones from old bead mills or factories no
            longer in operation.
